# PurrCatory

A small collection of 2 builds of my first ever collaboration game, PurrCatory. Originally planned as my first ever commercial game with many sequels, This overly ambitious piece of shit was canned at the early alpha stages.. Mostly due to a.. sudden.. hard drive crash... and by that I mean it CRASHED into my floor when moving my laptop and forgetting it was plugged in.. The game was abandoned regardless... Because it sucks... REALLY badly. It's also responsible for why I'm friends with both SonicboomColt and Nhaselton to this day. So to say this game is special to me and my friends is a MASSIVE understatement... The game still sucks though XD

## Why are there 2 seperate builds?

The game was originally uploaded as a dev test demo. Meaning these aren't just 2 versions of the same game, They're technically 2 completely different games.. So uh..... Look, I just wanted an excuse to make another launcher XD
